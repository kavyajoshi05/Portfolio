					<p><b>My journey into the world of data analytics and machine learning began with a simple yet profound curiosity about how technology shapes our daily lives. Growing up in an era where data-driven decisions transformed industries, I became captivated by the potential of harnessing data to solve complex problems. This passion drove me to delve deeper into the fields of data science and artificial intelligence.</p><br>
				<p>I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Applications followed by a Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I’m pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at North Carolina State University.</p><br>
						
					<p>My experience includes internships at TCS iON and Verzeo.  At TCS ion, I worked as an Artificial Intelligence Intern, where I utilized advanced algorithms combining rule-based and deep learning approaches to accurately predict emotions expressed in English text, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 98%. At Verzeo, I worked as a Machine Learning Intern. I developed a machine learning model utilizing a support vector classifier and count vectorizer on a proprietary dataset to predict startup review sentiment, achieving 94% accuracy and optimizing decision-making processes.</p><br>
						
						<p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I am an avid reader with a particular love for contemporary fiction and mystery thrillers. Some of my favorite authors include J.K. Rowling, Dan Brown, and Agatha Christie. I also have a passion for painting and am an amateur guitarist. Additionally, I am a trained Bharatnatyam dancer, having completed my Bachelor's degree in this classical art form.</p><br>
						
					<p>I am currently seeking full time opportunities in the dynamic fields of data science and artificial intelligence. If you are looking for a dedicated and passionate individual with a strong background in data analytics, machine learning, and database management, I would love to connect!<br></p>
